# Localization

1. There are majorly three types of localization problems i.e. Local localization problem (The initial pose of the robot is known and the current pose as well as position is required to be estimated), Global localization problem (The initial pose of the robot is not known here), Robot Kidnapping Problem (In this problem the robot is teleported to different location at any random instance, and it needs to know its pose relative to the surrounding area of the map; worst case).

2. The environments for localization can also vary over time, leading to the distinction between static and dynamic environments, which obviouslly add more complexity to the localization problems. 

3. There are some popular ways of solving the localization problem i.e. Extended Kalman Filter method, Monte Carlo, etc.
